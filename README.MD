Huge thanks to Mick Hansen (@mhansen).

Built using `sequelize, graphql-sequelize`

Extract db script from `sqldb/graphql.zip`, import into your sql server.

Edit `src/models/index.js` to match your db config

Run `npm install`

Run with `node index.js`

Browse to `http://localhost:3001/graphql` for gui interface.

p.s. requires node v5
